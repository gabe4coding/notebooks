    "# From Zero to RAG: An Incremental, Hands-On Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this comprehensive tutorial on building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline from scratch! In this notebook, you'll learn how to create a complete RAG system incrementally, starting with basic keyword search and progressing to sophisticated semantic retrieval with re-ranking.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You'll Learn\n",
    "- Build retrieval systems using TF-IDF, BM25, and semantic embeddings\n",
    "- Implement hybrid retrieval combining lexical and semantic approaches\n",
    "- Apply rank fusion techniques (Reciprocal Rank Fusion)\n",
    "- Use cross-encoder re-ranking for improved precision\n",
    "- Create an end-to-end RAG pipeline with generation\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Gets Built\n",
    "By the end, you'll have a working RAG system that can answer questions about a synthetic knowledge base, complete with retrieval, re-ranking, and generation components.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Technical Constraints\n",
    "- **Python 3.10+** compatible code throughout\n",
    "- **Open-source models only** for embeddings and re-ranking (sentence-transformers, cross-encoders)\n",
    "- **Hugging Face Token for model access** required HF_TOKEN\n",
    "- **OpenAI SDK** used only for the final generation step; Needs OPENAI_API_KEY\n",
    "- All dependencies installable via pip"

    "\n",
    "![RAG Overview](https://medium.com/@drjulija/what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation-rag-938e4f6e03d1)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** combines information retrieval with text generation to create more accurate, grounded responses. Instead of relying solely on a language model's training data, RAG first retrieves relevant documents from a knowledge base, then uses those documents to generate answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Components\n",
    "1. **Indexing**: Preprocessing and storing documents for efficient retrieval\n",
    "2. **Retrieval**: Finding relevant documents given a query\n",
    "3. **Fusion**: Combining results from multiple retrieval methods\n",
    "4. **Re-ranking**: Refining the order of retrieved documents\n",
    "5. **Generation**: Creating answers using retrieved context\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Benefits\n",
    "- **Reduces hallucinations** by grounding responses in actual documents\n",
    "- **Enables up-to-date information** without retraining models\n",
    "- **Provides citations** for transparency and verification\n",
    "- **Scales efficiently** to large knowledge bases\n",
    "\n",
    "### Trade-offs\n",
    "RAG adds complexity and latency but dramatically improves factual accuracy and allows dynamic knowledge updates. The retrieval quality directly impacts the final answer quality."
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "## Dataset Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "Quality retrieval starts with quality data. Clean, well-structured documents are essential for effective RAG systems. Each document should have consistent fields and clear, focused content.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Principles\n",
    "- **Structured format**: Use consistent fields (id, title, text) for easy processing\n",
    "- **Appropriate granularity**: Documents should be focused but comprehensive\n",
    "- **Clean text**: Remove formatting artifacts, normalize whitespace\n",
    "- **Diverse content**: Include varied topics to test retrieval robustness\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our Synthetic Corpus\n",
    "We'll create a small but diverse dataset spanning multiple domains (astronomy, cooking, programming, history, health, sports). This allows us to test different retrieval methods on varied content types. Including some near-duplicates and paraphrases helps evaluate robustness to semantic similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Licensing Note\n",
    "When using real data, always verify licensing terms and respect copyright. Our synthetic dataset avoids these concerns while providing realistic testing scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deterministic seeds** ensure reproducible results across runs, crucial for comparing retrieval methods fairly."

    "## TF-IDF: Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency\n",
    "\n",
    "**TF-IDF** is a fundamental text retrieval technique that scores documents based on term importance. It combines two concepts:\n",
    "- **Term Frequency (TF)**: How often a term appears in a document\n",
    "- **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)**: How rare a term is across the entire corpus\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intuition\n",
    "Words that appear frequently in a document but rarely across the corpus are most important for distinguishing that document. Common words like \"the\" and \"and\" get low scores, while specific terms get higher scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "Documents are converted to vectors where each dimension represents a unique term's TF-IDF score. Query similarity is computed using cosine similarity between the query vector and document vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages\n",
    "- **Fast and interpretable**: Clear scoring rationale\n",
    "- **No training required**: Works immediately on any corpus\n",
    "- **Memory efficient**: Sparse vectors for large vocabularies\n",

    "- **Vocabulary mismatch**: Can't match synonyms (\"car\" vs \"automobile\")\n",

    "## BM25: Best Matching 25\n",
    "\n",
    "**BM25** is a probabilistic ranking function that often outperforms TF-IDF for information retrieval. It improves upon TF-IDF by addressing two key limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Improvements\n",
    "1. **Term Saturation**: TF-IDF scores increase linearly with term frequency, but BM25 uses a saturation function. After a certain point, additional occurrences contribute less to the score.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Document Length Normalization**: BM25 adjusts for document length, preventing longer documents from having unfair advantages simply due to more term occurrences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameters\n",
    "- **k1** (typically 1.2-2.0): Controls term frequency saturation\n",
    "- **b** (typically 0.75): Controls document length normalization strength\n",
    "\n",
    "### When BM25 Excels\n",
    "BM25 typically outperforms TF-IDF for keyword search, especially with:\n",
    "- Varied document lengths\n",
    "- Collections where term frequency patterns matter\n",
    "- Traditional information retrieval tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "Both TF-IDF and BM25 are **lexical** methods—they rely on exact word matches and don't understand semantics."

    "## Rank Fusion: Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)** is a simple yet effective method for combining rankings from multiple retrieval systems. It's particularly robust because it relies on ranks rather than raw scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "### RRF Formula\n",
    "For each document, RRF computes:\n",
    "```\n",
    "RRF_score = Σ (1 / (k + rank_i))\n",
    "```\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- `rank_i` is the document's rank in system i\n",
    "- `k` is a constant (typically 60) that controls the contribution curve, preventing top ranks from dominating too much.\n",
    "- The sum is over all systems that retrieved the document\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why RRF Works Well\n",
    "1. **Rank-based**: Avoids issues with different score scales\n",
    "2. **Robust**: Less sensitive to outliers than score-based fusion\n",
    "3. **Simple**: No parameter tuning beyond choosing k\n",
    "4. **Proven**: Works well across different retrieval types\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameter k\n",
    "- **k=60** (default): Balanced contribution from all ranks\n",
    "- **Lower k**: Top ranks dominate more\n",
    "- **Higher k**: More uniform contribution across ranks\n",
    "\n",
    "Documents appearing in multiple systems get higher RRF scores, while high-ranking documents in any single system also score well."

    "## Re-ranking with Cross-Encoders\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cross-encoders** are transformer models that score (query, passage) pairs directly, providing more accurate relevance estimates than individual embeddings. They're the \"second stage\" in a two-stage retrieval pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Cross-Encoders Work\n",
    "Unlike bi-encoders (like sentence-transformers) that encode query and passage (or document) separately, cross-encoders:\n",
    "1. Concatenate query and passage as input: `[CLS] query [SEP] passage [SEP]` ([CLS] and [SEP] are special tokens used in models like BERT to denote the start and separation of sequences)\n",
    "2. Use full attention across query-passage pairs\n",
    "3. Output a single relevance score\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages\n",
    "- **Higher accuracy**: Full attention between query and passage\n",
    "- **Better ranking**: Specifically trained for relevance scoring\n",
    "- **Fine-grained scoring**: Can distinguish subtle relevance differences\n",
    "\n",
    "### Trade-offs\n",
    "- **Computational cost**: Must process each (query, candidate) pair\n",
    "- **Latency**: Slower than embedding-based similarity\n",
    "- **Scale limitations**: Practical only for re-ranking small candidate sets\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practice\n",
    "Use cross-encoders to re-rank the top-N (typically 10-50) candidates from faster retrieval methods. This gives you both speed and accuracy."

      "Black holes form when massive stars collapse under their own gravity at the end of their lifecycle. This collapse leads to the creation of a region in spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing, including light, can escape once it crosses the event horizon. The event horizon is defined as the boundary beyond which escape becomes impossible, marking the point of no return for any matter or radiation that approaches a black hole [doc_id: ast_001].\n",

      "Regular exercise offers several health benefits, particularly for the cardiovascular system. It strengthens the heart muscle, which enhances its efficiency in pumping blood throughout the body. This improved function leads to better circulation, allowing for more effective delivery of oxygen and nutrients to tissues while also facilitating the removal of waste products.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, exercise positively influences various factors related to cardiovascular health, such as cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and inflammation. By engaging in regular physical activity, individuals can maintain a healthy weight, which is crucial for cardiovascular health. Furthermore, exercise can help manage stress levels, contributing to overall well-being and reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases [doc_id: heal_002].\n",

    "- **Best for**: Systems where finding the first relevant document quickly is critical\n",
    "- **Example**: Question answering where users need one good answer\n",
    "- **Interpretation**: MRR=0.5 means on average, the first relevant document is at position 2\n",
    "\n",
    "**Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG)**  \n",
    "- **Best for**: Systems where ranking quality of all results matters\n",
    "- **Example**: Search engines where users browse multiple results\n",
    "- **Interpretation**: NDCG@5=0.8 means the ranking achieves 80% of the ideal score\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hit@K**\n",
    "- **Best for**: Simple binary assessment of retrieval success\n",
    "- **Example**: Basic \"did we find anything useful?\" evaluation\n",
    "- **Interpretation**: Hit@5=0.7 means 70% of queries had at least one relevant doc in top-5\n",
    "\n",
    "**Precision@K**\n",
    "- **Best for**: Systems where result quality (low false positives) is crucial\n",
    "- **Example**: Medical diagnosis support where wrong results are dangerous\n",
    "- **Interpretation**: P@5=0.6 means 60% of returned results are relevant\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recall@K**\n",
    "- **Best for**: Systems where completeness (low false negatives) is crucial  \n",
    "- **Example**: Legal discovery where missing documents has consequences\n",
    "- **Interpretation**: R@5=0.4 means we found 40% of all relevant documents\n",
    "\n",
    "**F1@K**\n",
    "- **Best for**: Balanced assessment of precision and recall\n",
